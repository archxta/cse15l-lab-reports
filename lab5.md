## Original post from student 

I'm working on a program to process a list of words, but I'm encountering unexpected behavior. The program is supposed to capitalize the first letter of each word in the list, but for some words, it's not working correctly. Instead of capitalizing the first letter, it's converting the entire word to uppercase. I suspect there's a bug in my string processing logic. Attached below is a screenshot illustrating the problem.

## TA Response

It appears that your program encounters an issue with capitalizing the first letter of each word. Have you checked how you're splitting the input string into words? It seems like the program is treating each word as a separate string instead of processing the entire input string. I recommend examining your string splitting logic to ensure it correctly separates words based on whitespace characters
