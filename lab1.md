# lab 1
## cd command
1. **no args**

Current working directory: home
```
  architap@Architas-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd
  architap@Architas-MacBook-Pro ~ % 
```
The command cd with no args brought me back to the home directory, and since my current working directory was already at home, this command does not change the directory. This output is not an error. 

2. **path to directory as argument**

Current working directory: home  
```
architap@Architas-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd cse15l-lab-reports/
architap@Architas-MacBook-Pro cse15l-lab-reports % 

```
The command cd with a path to the cse15l-lab-reports directory brought me back to the cse15l-lab-reports directory as shown above. Thus, the current directory changed from home to cse15l-lab-reports after running this command. This output is not an error. 

3.  **path to file as argument**

Current working directory: home  
```
architap@Architas-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd cse15l-lab-reports/
architap@Architas-MacBook-Pro cse15l-lab-reports % 

```
